of New York Mellon Corporation reported on the income statement less earnings allocated to participating securities, and the change in the 
 
excess of redeemable value over the fair value of noncontrolling interests. 
Includes fee revenue, net interest revenue and income of consolidated investment management funds, net of net income attributable to 
 
noncontrolling interests. 

(a)	  Diluted earnings per share under the two-class method is determined on the net income applicable to common shareholders of The Bank 
 
 
 
(b)	 
 
 
(c)	  Excludes securities lending cash management assets and assets managed in the Investment Services business. 
(d)	  The estimated Basel III Tier 1 common equity ratio at Dec. 31, 2013, is based on our interpretation of the final capital rules released by 
 
 
 
(e)	  See “Supplemental Information – Explanation of GAAP and Non-GAAP financial measures” beginning on page 118 for a calculation of these ratios. 
(f)	  Changes in January 2014 to the probable loss model associated with unsecured wholesale credit exposures within our Advanced Approach 
 
capital model will impact risk-weighted assets. The Company did not include the impact at Dec. 31, 2013. However, a preliminary estimate of 
 
 
 
the revised methodology to the portfolio at Sept. 30, 2013, would have added approximately 6% to the risk-weighted assets. 

 
the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve (the “Federal Reserve”) on July 2, 2013, on a fully phased-in basis. At Dec. 31, 2012, this ratio 
  
was estimated using our interpretation of the Federal Reserve’s Notices of Proposed Rulemaking dated June 7, 2012, on a fully phased-in basis.
