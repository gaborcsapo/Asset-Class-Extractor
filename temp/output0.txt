 

One of Invescoâ€™s greatest competitive strengths is the diversification in its AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset 
class. Our distribution network has gathered assets of 61% retail, 36% institutional, and 3% Private Wealth Management clients as of 
December 31, 2010. 32.6% of client assets under management are outside the U.S., and we serve clients in more than 150 countries. 
The following tables present a breakdown of AUM by client domicile, distribution channel and asset class as of December 31, 2010. 
Additionally, the fourth table below illustrates the split of our higher-fee non-passive AUM as compared to our lower-fee ETF, UIT, 
and passive AUM.
