Results of Operations (continued)

Performance fees were $97 million in 2015 compared 
with $111 million in 2014.  The decrease primarily 
reflects the unfavorable impact of a stronger U.S. 
dollar.

Distribution and servicing fees were $152 million in 
2015 compared with $157 million in 2014.  The 
decrease was primarily driven by the unfavorable 
impact of a stronger U.S. dollar, partially offset by 
lower money market fee waivers.

Other revenue was $88 million in 2015 compared 
with $83 million in 2014.  The increase primarily 
reflects higher other trading revenue related to losses 
on hedging activities within a boutique recorded in 
2014.

Net interest revenue was $319 million in 2015 
compared with $274 million in 2014.  The increase 
primarily resulted from higher average loans and 
deposits.  Average loans increased 18% in 2015 
compared with 2014, while average deposits 
increased 7% in 2015 compared with 2014.

Noninterest expense, excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and the charge related to investment 
management funds, net of incentives, was $2.8 billion 
in 2015, a decrease of $55 million, or 2%, compared 
with 2014.  The decrease primarily reflects the 
favorable impact of a stronger U.S. dollar and lower 
incentives, partially offset by investments in strategic 
initiatives.

in 2014, a decrease of $1 million compared with

2014, or 2% compared with 2013, primarily resulting 
from higher investment management fees, partially 
offset by lower performance fees, distribution and 
servicing revenue and lower other trading revenue 
related to losses on hedging activities within a 
boutique.  Net interest revenue increased $14 million 
in 2014, or 5% compared with 2013 primarily 
resulting from higher average loans and deposits.  
Noninterest expense excluding amortization of 
intangible assets and the charge related to investment 
management funds, net of incentives, increased $79 
million in 2014, or 3% compared with 2013.  The 
increase primarily resulted from higher staff, business 
development and purchased services expenses 
resulting from investments in strategic initiatives as 
well as the unfavorable impact of a weaker U.S. 
dollar.
